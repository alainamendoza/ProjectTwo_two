# project overview

My Project, *Words in Motion*, explores the meaning of community through interactive design using HTML and CSS. I've chosen lyrcs from *You'd Be Stars* by Sydney Rose (feat. Chloe Moriondo) to represent what community means to me. Through motion, my site will bring these words to life, visually expressing the sense of belonging and trust that defines community to me.

# technical overview

Themes of community represented:
- support and belonging
- shared experiences
- emotional safety
- everyday connection

Through this project, I aimed to create an immersive experience that illustrates the deep bonds that community provides.
